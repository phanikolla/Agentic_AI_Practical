## üìö About This Module
This module is the go-to resource for practical, hands-on learning in agentic AI. It features:
- Step-by-step agent construction (ReAct, LangGraph, agentic search)
- Real-world integrations (OpenAI, Tavily, DuckDuckGo, web scraping)
- Fully annotated, modular Jupyter notebooks

Whether you're a student, researcher, or developer, you'll find practical knowledge and extensible code to accelerate your agentic AI journey.

## üöÄ Quick Start
1. Navigate to the [`langgraph/`](./langgraph) folder.
2. Open the [README](./langgraph/README.md) for detailed instructions and notebook guides.
3. Launch any notebook in Jupyter or VS Code and start exploring!

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with Jupyter extension
- API keys for OpenAI and Tavily (for full functionality)

## üß© LangGraph & Agentic AI Notebooks
The `langgraph/` folder is your go-to resource for hands-on, modular Jupyter notebooks focused on building, analyzing, and extending agentic AI systems. Each notebook is self-contained, fully annotated, and designed for both beginners and advanced users.

### Key Topics & Notebooks
- **Agent_Creation.ipynb**: Step-by-step construction of a ReAct agent from scratch, with custom actions and OpenAI integration.
- **Langgraph_components.ipynb**: Deep dive into LangGraph agent components, state management, and advanced agent flows.
- **Agentic_search_tools.ipynb**: Practical agentic search and web scraping using Tavily, DuckDuckGo, and BeautifulSoup.
- **Human in the Loop.ipynb**: Demonstrates human-in-the-loop workflows for agentic AI systems.
- **Persistence and Streaming.ipynb**: Shows how to persist agent state and stream outputs for robust, real-world applications.
- **My_Personal_Agent.ipynb**: Builds a personalized agentic AI assistant, integrating multiple tools and APIs.

### Getting Started
- **Prerequisites**: Python 3.8+, Jupyter Notebook or VS Code, API keys for OpenAI and Tavily (for full functionality)
- **Usage**: Open any notebook in Jupyter or VS Code and run the cells step by step. Each notebook can be studied independently or as part of the full Agentic_AI curriculum.

For full details, see the [`langgraph/README.md`](./langgraph/README.md).

## üß© MCP: Modular Component Projects
The `MCP` directory contains standalone, practical AI modules that can be used independently or integrated into larger agentic AI systems.

### Included MCP Projects
- [`mcp-sentiment`](./MCP/mcp-sentiment/): Gradio-powered sentiment analysis tool with a web UI. See its [README](./MCP/mcp-sentiment/README.md) for setup and usage.
