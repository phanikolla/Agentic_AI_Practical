## 📚 About This Module
This module is the go-to resource for practical, hands-on learning in agentic AI. It features:
- Step-by-step agent construction (ReAct, LangGraph, agentic search)
- Real-world integrations (OpenAI, Tavily, DuckDuckGo, web scraping)
- Fully annotated, modular Jupyter notebooks

Whether you're a student, researcher, or developer, you'll find practical knowledge and extensible code to accelerate your agentic AI journey.

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. Navigate to the [`langgraph/`](./langgraph) folder.
2. Open the [README](./langgraph/README.md) for detailed instructions and notebook guides.
3. Launch any notebook in Jupyter or VS Code and start exploring!

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with Jupyter extension
- API keys for OpenAI and Tavily (for full functionality)
