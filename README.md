<h1 align="center">üß† Agentic AI Practical Module</h1>

<p align="center">
  <em>The go-to resource for hands-on, modern agentic AI development.<br/>
  Explore, build, and extend agentic AI systems with practical, modular Jupyter notebooks.</em>
</p>

## üìö About This Module
This module is the go-to resource for practical, hands-on learning in agentic AI. It features:
- Step-by-step agent construction (ReAct, LangGraph, agentic search)
- Real-world integrations (OpenAI, Tavily, DuckDuckGo, web scraping)
- Fully annotated, modular Jupyter notebooks

Whether you're a student, researcher, or developer, you'll find practical knowledge and extensible code to accelerate your agentic AI journey.

## üöÄ Quick Start
1. Navigate to the [`langgraph/`](./langgraph) folder for agentic AI notebooks and guides.
2. Navigate to the [`langchain_practical/`](./langchain_practical) folder for LangChain demos and practical guides.
3. Open the [README](./langgraph/README.md) or [LangChain Practical README](./langchain_practical/README.md) for detailed instructions and notebook guides.
4. Launch any notebook in Jupyter or VS Code and start exploring!

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with Jupyter extension
- API keys for OpenAI and Tavily (for full functionality)

## üß© MCP: Modular Component Projects
The `MCP` directory contains standalone, practical AI modules that can be used independently or integrated into larger agentic AI systems.

### Included MCP Projects
- [`mcp-sentiment`](./MCP/mcp-sentiment/): Gradio-powered sentiment analysis tool with a web UI. See its [README](./MCP/mcp-sentiment/README.md) for setup and usage.

---

## ü¶æ LangChain Practical
The `langchain_practical` directory contains hands-on, modular Jupyter notebooks and demos for learning and experimenting with LangChain's advanced features for language model applications.

### Key Areas Covered
- **Function Calling**: OpenAI function calling, custom tools, error handling
- **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)**: Composable chains, workflow building
- **Tagging & Extraction**: NER, information extraction, data validation
- **Tools & Routing APIs**: Custom tool creation, API integration, schema validation
- **Conversational Agent**: Multi-turn agents, tool integration, dynamic conversations

See the [`langchain_practical/README.md`](./langchain_practical/README.md) for detailed guides, code examples, and usage instructions.
